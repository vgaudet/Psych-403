#Assignment 2: Level 0: A New Language

##Print Exercises

	1. Complete. 
	
	2. The variables do show up in the variable explorer, if defined outside of a function

##Operation Exercises
	1. My version of python outputs the same response for 5/2 and 5.0/2.0 as 2.5.
	2. The modulo operator returns the remainder of a division. For example 5%2 is 1 which is the remainder of 5/2.
	3. The ** operation results in an exponent operation (2**2 = 2^2). // results in a division where the result is always rounded down to the lower integer.
	4. Python does follow order of operations. 

##Variable Exercises
	1. Complete.
	2. The letter variables do display in the Variable Explorer if defined outside of a function.
	3. N/A.
	4. Python does not have a problem with different variables having the same value.
	5. No, changing the value of letterX does not change the value of other variables.
	6. Changing the value of letter1 will not change the value of letterX. When a variable, A, is assigned to be another variable, B, A will be equal to the value of B at the time it was assigned and will not automatically update to a new value of B if the value of B changes.

##Boolean Exercises
	1. 1 and 1.0 are equivalent. "1" and "1.0" are not equivalent. This is because 1 and 1.0 are being evaluated numerically as 1 = 1.0, where mathematically they have the same value. "1" and "1.0" are being evaluated as strings and "1" and "1.0" are different strings. 
	2. 5 and (3+2) are equivalent. 
	3. 
		(1 == 1.0) and ("1" == "1.0") or (5 == (3+2))
		(1 == 1.0) or ("1" == "1.0") or (5 == (3+2))
		(1 == 1.0) and not ("1" == "1.0") or (5 == (3+2))
		(1 == 1.0) or not ("1" == "1.0") or (5 == (3+2))
		(1 == 1.0) and not ("1" == "1.0") or not (5 == (3+2))
##List Exercises
	1. Yes, it does become a variable
	2. No error.
	3. Python says the list length is 5.
	4. Python says the list variable type is list.
	5. Complete.
	6. Yes.

##Dictionary Exercises
	1. Complete.
	2. The returned type is dict
	3. The length of the dictionary is the amount of dictionary fields.

##Array Exercises
	1. All elements of the array were turned into float type.
	2. Python, as shown in this case, turns the array into string type when mixed.
	3. Complete.
	4. Complete.
